        <h2>Timeline of Ernest Rutherford's Life</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Born 30 August 1871 Nelson, New Zealand</li>
          <li>He studied at Havelock School and then Nelson College.</li>
          <li>He won a scholarship to study at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand where he gained his BA, MA and BSc.</li>
          <li>In 1984 he was awarded a scholarship to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, UK as a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory.</li>
          <li>In 1898, he took up a post as the Macdonald Chair of Physics at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. He expanded upon the work of Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie to show that radiation was made up of alpha, beta and gamma rays.</li>
          <li> Rutherford returned to England in 1907 as Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester. He proposed a new structure for the atom, seeing it as a miniature solar system with the nucleus at the centre and electrons orbiting it.</li>
          <li>In 1908 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances.</li>
          <li>iIn 1917 that he first achieved nuclear fission – or, as it is commonly referred to, splitting the atom – by firing naturally occurring alpha particles into nitrogen gas. After his discovery, scientists began to realise that the atom is not just a single particle but is made up of much smaller subatomic particles.</li>
          <li>During his life, he received numerous awards and recognitions, such as a knighthood in 1914 and the Royal Society of New Zealand’s Hector Medal, and in 1931, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Rutherford of Nelson, of Cambridge – a title that became extinct upon his death.</li>
          <li>Dies 19 October 1937 (aged 66) in Cambridge United Kingdom.  His ashes were buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey, close to the tombs of Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin.</li>
